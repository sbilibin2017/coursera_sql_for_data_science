Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10 000
ii. Business table = 10 000
iii. Category table = 10 000
iv. Checkin table = 10 000
v. elite_years table = 10 000
vi. friend table = 10 000
vii. hours table = 10 000
viii. photo table = 10 000
ix. review table = 10 000 
x. tip table = 10 000
xi. user table =10 000
	

Sample code (including NULL values):

select count(*) as total_records
from attribute

+---------------+
| total_records |
+---------------+
|         10000 |
+---------------+


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. 	Business = id: 10000
ii. 	Hours = business_id: 1562
iii. 	Category = business_id: 2643
iv. 	Attribute = business_id: 1115
v. 	Review = id:10000, business_id: 8090, user_id: 9581
vi. 	Checkin = business_id: 493
vii. 	Photo = id: 10000, business_id: 6493
viii. 	Tip = user_id: 537, business_id: 3979
ix. 	User = id: 10000
x. 	Friend = user_id: 11
xi. 	Elite_years = user_id: 2780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	

select count(distinct c.business_id) as unique_counts
from category c

+---------------+
| unique_counts |
+---------------+
|          2643 |
+---------------+
 

3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?

	Yes, they have a different number of reviews.          
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.


SQL code used for analysis:

select
b.name,
b.stars,
b.neighborhood
,b.city
,c.category

,h.hours
,b.review_count
,b.postal_code
from (business b inner join category c on b.id = c.business_id)
  inner join hours h on h.business_id = c.business_id
where (b.city = 'Toronto')  
 group by b.stars;

2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.


i. Difference 1:
The businesses that are still open have higher rating.
         
         
ii. Difference 2:
         
The businesses that are still open have more reviews.   

iii.	Difference 3:
The businesses that are still open have shorter working hours
      
         
SQL code used for analysis:
select
business.is_open
, category.category
, business.stars
, hours.hours
, business.review_count
from (business inner join category on business.id = category.business_id) inner join hours on hours.business_id = category.business_id
where business.city = 'Toronto' 
 group by business.is_open;
	

+---------+-------------+-------+----------------------+--------------+
| is_open | category    | stars | hours                | review_count |
+---------+-------------+-------+----------------------+--------------+
|       0 | Restaurants |   2.0 | Saturday|11:00-23:00 |            5 |
|       1 | Restaurants |   4.0 | Saturday|18:00-23:00 |           89 |
+---------+-------------+-------+----------------------+--------------+
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:

examine levels of usefulness and funnyness by states          
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
i need two sources of data : state(from business table) and levels of usefulness and funnyness from review table
maybe in different states people tend to examine different characteristics                            
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
 +-------+----------------+-----------------+
| state |     useful_avg |       funny_avg |
+-------+----------------+-----------------+
| AZ    | 0.792929292929 |  0.232323232323 |
| BW    |            0.0 |             0.0 |
| EDH   |            0.6 |             0.0 |
| IL    |            0.5 |             0.0 |
| NC    |            1.0 | 0.0666666666667 |

| WI    | 0.294117647059 | 0.0588235294118 |
+-------+----------------+-----------------+        
         
iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:

select b.state
,avg(r.useful) as useful_avg
,avg(r.funny) as funny_avg

from business b inner join review r on b.id = r.business_id
group by b.state
